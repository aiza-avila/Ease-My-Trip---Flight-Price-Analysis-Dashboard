# Ease-My-Trip--Flight-Price-Analysis-Dashboard
Data visualization tool using Panel library to explore in a graphic way the behavior of the flights booked through the webpage Ease My Trip.

As part of the Data Visualization course at Master in Data Sciences & Business Analytics (DSBA) - ESSEC & CentraleSupélec, I and my team (Vanshika SHARMA, Michele Natacha ELA ESSOLA, Yunqiu ZHANG and myself) created a data visualization tool using Panel library to explore in a graphic way the behavior of the flights booked through the webpage Ease My Trip.

## Dataset
For this project, we used a kaggle dataset titled 'Flight Price Prediction'. The link to the website is as follows: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction

The dataset contains information about flight booking options for 6 India metro cities from an Indian online travel booking web page called “Ease My Trip” between February 11th to March 31st 2022. The dataset has 300153 observations and 11 features.

For our dashboard, we have also added latitude and longitude of the destination city as features, so that we could create the bubble chart. The updated dataset is split into 2 parts (due to dataset limit) and is available in this repository.

## Packages Required
For creating this dashboard, we have used the following libraries:

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Plotly
* Panel
